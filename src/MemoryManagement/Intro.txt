In Java thee are two types of memory present inside the jvm
* Stack Memory
* Heap Memory

S-Used to store primitive and references
H- used to store objects and it has a string pool (new  keyword)

in java there is an amazing feature avaiable gc to collect the unused objects ot that has no ref
there are three  types of ref avaiable
Strong - it cant easily removed by gc
Weak - easily removed by gc
Soft - it is sim to weak and in case of urgency it will be removed

In heap there will be 2 parts after java 8 meta space is seprated

i) Young gen here the obj are created
ii) Old gen here the string ref obj are stored

Heap uses Mark and sweep algo
